It really is all at hand. Just below the house there is a delicious pastry shop for breakfast and a multi-award winning bar for aperitif. In summer, a few meters away, the so-called ""Jazz Lounge"" is set up outdoors, and not infrequently the Teatro Comunale organizes free concerts in the foyer. The characteristic neighborhood of the former Jewish ""ghetto"" is located a few meters away, as well as the ""Two Towers"". Piazza Maggiore is just 500 meters away. The area also lends itself to the most unrestrained shopping: from the luxury and branded one of Galleria Cavour, via Farini and via D'Azeglio, to the most accessible (Zara, H&M, Zara Home, etc.), from the characteristic gastronomic one of the ""Mercato di Mezzo"", a riot of colors and flavors, to the gastronomic/cultural one of Eataly.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/de621f37-6c46-416e-a7b8-ef31f1a50cdb.jpg,11606565,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/11606565,Cristina,2014-01-24,"Marche, Italy","""Questa casa non è un albergo"" è il mio motto. Far sentire gli ospiti come a casa loro, il mio obiettivo. Ho cercato di far tesoro di tutte quelle piccole o grandi cose che hanno reso i miei viaggi o le mie vacanze meno piacevoli di quanto avrebbero potuto essere: una colazione misera, un letto troppo piccolo o troppo duro, una stanza rumorosa o in cui trapelava la luce mattutina, un box doccia minuscolo, l'asciugacapelli adatto ad un bimbo, non certo ai preziosissimi capelli di una donna, e potrei continuare... e sulla scorta delle mie esperienze ho allestito un appartamento su misura per viaggiatori molto esigenti. Ogni ospite ha un'accoglienza personalizzata, basata sui propri gusti, le proprie preferenze e le caratteristiche del proprio viaggio.
Bologna è una città meravigliosa, immeritatamente meno nota di altre città d'arte italiane. E' vivace, accogliente, ricca di sapori, odori e colori. 
Il mio appartamento è situato in una zona del centro storico perfetta per scoprire la città in tutti i suoi risvolti: da quello artistico, a quello gastronomico, da quello della musica, a quello della vivacità della vita studentesca dell'Alma Mater, la più antica Università del mondo, datata 1088.
La mia ospitalità sarà gentile e generosa, come la persona che cerco di essere ogni giorno.

You probably already know my name, so I would like to tell you something more about me. Are you ready?
After completing my degree in Architecture, I worked for 2 years as interior designer, but I didn’t quite enjoy working in an office environment, so I became a freelance with the purpose to realize objects in wood, paper, plastic, leather, fabric. I became very passionate about everything ‘handmade’.

I have always enjoyed the encounter with new people, cultures and lifestyles and for this reason I have travelled extensively between Europe, Middle and Far East (Japan, China, Iran, Israel), learning a huge amount from the different encounters I had. 

I have always been fascinated by what happens in the process of catching the eye of someone who is different from myself.  I very much enjoy opening up to new experiences and discover what’s beyond the appearance. 

I carry a desire to find beauty through art, which takes me to be creative and passionate in my daily life. I love art as a whole, from video and visual art, through poetry, drama, graphics and finally music. 

I would like to offer a service that is really person-centered and I genuinely want to be there for my guests. I firmly believe that true hospitality brings a healthy and nourishing exchange between human beings, and I am very much looking forward to meet you and make you feel welcomed by offering the best I can to each of you. 



Ciao a tutti! Il mio nome già lo conoscete, allora vi dico qualcosa in più di me. Siete pronti!! Dopo gli studi in Architettura ed il conseguimento dell'abilitazione, ho lavorato per due anni occupandomi di "" interior design"", ma sebbene sia progettista il lavoro d'ufficio non faceva per me, quindi mi sono lanciata nella realizzazione di oggetti in legno, carta, stoffa, plastica, e cuoio, coltivando la passione per tutto ciò che è ""handmade"".
Il contatto con gli altri, la loro cultura, le loro origini e stili di vita, mi ha spinto negli anni a viaggiare tanto, tra Europa e Oriente (Giappone, Cina, Iran, Israele) imparando molto da loro. I tanti volti incontrati mi dicono sguardi: sguardi che si ricevono, che vengono a me, che mi prendono di mira. Essere davanti ad un volto significa in primo luogo essere sotto uno sguardo; aprirsi ad un mondo perché esso stesso è incontro di un mondo.
L'Arte e la sua Bellezza in qualche modo sono sempre con me ed io in cambio metto a suo servizio la mia creatività e passione. Nell'Arte metto tutto ciò che essa comprende ( poesia, ""video art"", ""visual art"", grafica, pittura, teatro, musica).
Ne sono una ricercatrice attenta. Che dire se non: fare della propria vita quello che si proclama.
Ecco che il servizio che vorrei offrire va alla persona ed è per la persona nei limiti delle mie possibilità: io ci sono. Offrire il meglio che oggi può sembrare poco, ma un domani sarà di più. Infine credo fermamente che ospitalità sia sinonimo di accoglienza reciproca.
Giunti al termine di questo breve racconto, spero d'incontrarvi un giorno.
Grazie.

Davvero molto difficile scrivere di me. Mi piace incontrare persone in viaggio e condividere l'esperienza dell'incontro.
Da universitario ero iscritto ad Hospitality Club, il sito per viaggiare ed ospitare gratuitamente persone, ma poi ho dovuto smettere. Ora che ho nuovamente la libertà di ospitare persone in casa, ho pensato che Airbnb fosse fosse il giusto equilibrio tra l'affitto da pagare e il piacere di ospitare i viaggiatori.

Curo l'amministrazione di una compagnia teatrale, gestisco una piccola società che organizza eventi di piazza e servizi bici, mentre con un'altra associazione di cui sono fondatore facciamo la mitica asta di biciclette a basso costo e curo progetti sociali per la città -  E' un lavoro strano, senza orari, che mi porta ad essere spesso fuori casa e sempre a contatto con le persone. Però, escluso il fatto che mi tiene inchiodato a Bologna, mi piace.
Il mondo è troppo grande per essere visitato tutto, allora ospitare i viaggiatori diventa per me un modo per conosce un pezzo di mondo senza esserci stato.

Cosa mi piace?
mille cose, ne cito qualcuna
cucinare, sia la cucina tradizionale ma anche la sperimentazione;
andare in bici - è comodo, divertente e rilassante. Poi Bologna in bici è molto facile;
i giochi - ping pong, biliardino, calcio. Qualsiasi gioco che faccia divertire;
d'inverno mi piace organizzare cene in casa con gli amici, guardare un bel film oppure giocare (carte, risiko, ecc.).

Non mi piace andare alle feste, forse perché spesso ne sono l'organizzatore, allora non riesco a rilassarmi e divertirmi fino in fondo.
