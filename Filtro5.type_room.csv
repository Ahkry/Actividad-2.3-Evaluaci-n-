I am an upfront but hands off host. I really like to travel and I am passionate about cultures and countries, so I am happy to know more about my guests, but I also want to respect them and their personalities and make them feel at ease, so the first thing I do is smiling!
If I have time, it's a pleasure for me to hang out with the people I host; if not, anyway I do my best for them making themselves home, having a good time and making the most in amazing Bologna.
I am not perfect, my house's not perfect too! I decided to open the door to travellers to offer a different and genuine home stay, the good the bad and the weird.
If you are looking for a hotel standard maybe this is not the right accomodation for you. If you are that type of guest who feels the need to find every possible reason to report or complain about, please, stay elsewhere :) I really don't feel the urge to rate you as a guest, we are all humans raised in different environments and I think tolerance and acceptance of diversity is more important than rules. So please, if you book, don't feel the urge to rate me as a host as well, especially because I do everything by myself, from taking care of the house to the cleaning/washing, from communication to welcoming...a hard job and a lot of responsibility!
If you like me strongly believe in human beings, and find interesting to get in contact with people raised in different cultures, I'll be very happy to host you in my place, and the best review I could receive is if you feel home!",a few days or more,44%,51%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/467810/profile_pic/1358730088/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/467810/profile_pic/1358730088/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,2,9,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy",Porto - Saragozza,,44.49168,11.33514,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,1.0,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Bed linens"", ""Dining table"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Exercise equipment: yoga mat"", ""Clothing storage: closet"", ""Hangers"", ""Essentials"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Body soap"", ""Heating"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Wifi"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Hot water"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Freezer"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Smoking allowed"", ""Host greets you"", ""Single level home"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Bidet"", ""Coffee"", ""Microwave"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Coffee maker""]",$43.00,2,730,2,2,730,730,2.0,730.0,,t,13,41,71,71,2024-09-17,437,47,1,2010-09-27,2024-09-15,4.72,4.74,4.6,4.83,4.85,4.84,4.67,,f,2,0,2,0,2.57

Amo il cinema e la buona musica.
Mi diverto a dipingere, a cucinare, sperimento piatti di cucina internazionale, ed anche della buona cucina bolognese.
Amo prendermi cura dei fiori, delle piante e quando la stagione lo permette coltivo un piccolo orto in terrazza.
Non  uso cibi geneticamente modificati.Prediligo prodotti biologici deei dintorni di Bologna, quelli detti anche corta trafila, a km 0.
Ho amici sparsi in tutto il mondo, prima o poi riuscir√≤ ad andar a trovarli tutti.
Penso che non ci sia nulla che ci pu√≤ far crescere pi√π che la condivisione, lo stare insieme ed il prendersi cura di noi e di chi incontriamo sul nostro cammino, che siano umani o animali.
Il sorriso e la gentilezza sono miei alleati.
Il resto lo scoprirete se vorrete esser miei compagni di viaggio.

Davvero molto difficile scrivere di me. Mi piace incontrare persone in viaggio e condividere l'esperienza dell'incontro.
Da universitario ero iscritto ad Hospitality Club, il sito per viaggiare ed ospitare gratuitamente persone, ma poi ho dovuto smettere. Ora che ho nuovamente la libert√† di ospitare persone in casa, ho pensato che Airbnb fosse fosse il giusto equilibrio tra l'affitto da pagare e il piacere di ospitare i viaggiatori.

Curo l'amministrazione di una compagnia teatrale, gestisco una piccola societ√† che organizza eventi di piazza e servizi bici, mentre con un'altra associazione di cui sono fondatore facciamo la mitica asta di biciclette a basso costo e curo progetti sociali per la citt√† -  E' un lavoro strano, senza orari, che mi porta ad essere spesso fuori casa e sempre a contatto con le persone. Per√≤, escluso il fatto che mi tiene inchiodato a Bologna, mi piace.
Il mondo √® troppo grande per essere visitato tutto, allora ospitare i viaggiatori diventa per me un modo per conosce un pezzo di mondo senza esserci stato.

Cosa mi piace?
mille cose, ne cito qualcuna
cucinare, sia la cucina tradizionale ma anche la sperimentazione;
andare in bici - √® comodo, divertente e rilassante. Poi Bologna in bici √® molto facile;
i giochi - ping pong, biliardino, calcio. Qualsiasi gioco che faccia divertire;
d'inverno mi piace organizzare cene in casa con gli amici, guardare un bel film oppure giocare (carte, risiko, ecc.).

Non mi piace andare alle feste, forse perch√© spesso ne sono l'organizzatore, allora non riesco a rilassarmi e divertirmi fino in fondo.

Davvero molto difficile scrivere di me. Mi piace incontrare persone in viaggio e condividere l'esperienza dell'incontro.
Da universitario ero iscritto ad Hospitality Club, il sito per viaggiare ed ospitare gratuitamente persone, ma poi ho dovuto smettere. Ora che ho nuovamente la libert√† di ospitare persone in casa, ho pensato che Airbnb fosse fosse il giusto equilibrio tra l'affitto da pagare e il piacere di ospitare i viaggiatori.

Curo l'amministrazione di una compagnia teatrale, gestisco una piccola societ√† che organizza eventi di piazza e servizi bici, mentre con un'altra associazione di cui sono fondatore facciamo la mitica asta di biciclette a basso costo e curo progetti sociali per la citt√† -  E' un lavoro strano, senza orari, che mi porta ad essere spesso fuori casa e sempre a contatto con le persone. Per√≤, escluso il fatto che mi tiene inchiodato a Bologna, mi piace.
Il mondo √® troppo grande per essere visitato tutto, allora ospitare i viaggiatori diventa per me un modo per conosce un pezzo di mondo senza esserci stato.

Cosa mi piace?
mille cose, ne cito qualcuna
cucinare, sia la cucina tradizionale ma anche la sperimentazione;
andare in bici - √® comodo, divertente e rilassante. Poi Bologna in bici √® molto facile;
i giochi - ping pong, biliardino, calcio. Qualsiasi gioco che faccia divertire;
d'inverno mi piace organizzare cene in casa con gli amici, guardare un bel film oppure giocare (carte, risiko, ecc.).

Non mi piace andare alle feste, forse perch√© spesso ne sono l'organizzatore, allora non riesco a rilassarmi e divertirmi fino in fondo.

Those who do not visit a lot will be surprised: the center, and more, has become half of international tourists and offers services that until recently did not exist. This change is reflected (in negative) in prices: those in the center are very high, those in the neighborhoods nearby, including Bolognina, a little more affordable. <br /><br />Local types: so many, it depends on what you want to do.

Mi diverto a dipingere, a cucinare, sperimento piatti di cucina internazionale, ed anche della buona cucina bolognese.
Amo prendermi cura dei fiori, delle piante e quando la stagione lo permette coltivo un piccolo orto in terrazza.
Non  uso cibi geneticamente modificati.Prediligo prodotti biologici deei dintorni di Bologna, quelli detti anche corta trafila, a km 0.
Ho amici sparsi in tutto il mondo, prima o poi riuscir√≤ ad andar a trovarli tutti.
Penso che non ci sia nulla che ci pu√≤ far crescere pi√π che la condivisione, lo stare insieme ed il prendersi cura di noi e di chi incontriamo sul nostro cammino, che siano umani o animali.

Il resto lo scoprirete se vorrete esser miei compagni di viaggio.

We usually spend 3 months of the year abroad, whether in Indonesia, Turkey, Greece, or Northern California, we enjoy outdoor adventures, photography and music. 

Nicole is a swimmer-runner-cyclist, who worked as a costume designer in Los Angeles before moving to Italy. She loves textiles, gardening, cooking and currently works as a freelancer writer and graphic designer while raising our two small daughters.

Manu grew up in nearby Modena, has a passion for Italian food, and spent the last ten years touring Italy/Europe as a pro musician before settling in Bologna to work in advertising. He loves sports, especially surfing when we can stay by the ocean.

We really enjoy living in Bologna, scootering through the appenine backcountry, exploring the medieval fortresses, and beautiful Bolognese streets at night. For us it will always be the romantic Italian city where we met and married, and we love to help visitors discover the hidden secrets of this often overlooked gem of a city, and surrounding areas.

We have three guest rooms at the front of the house are set up to be cosy retreats with a nice view while traveling in Italy. It is possible to come and go independently, or if you‚Äôre feeling social our common kitchen is a happy place to share a glass of wine or cappuccino, some chats and a taste of Italy for any travelers who would appreciate a local welcome with a flavor of home.
